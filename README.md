# IoT-Data-Pipeline-with-Cloud-Based-Processing

Built a **real-time IoT data pipeline** leveraging **Azure services** to monitor, process, and analyze data generated by IoT devices. The project simulates IoT data using **Python**, streams it to **Azure IoT Hub**, and processes the data with **Azure Stream Analytics** to store structured outputs in **Azure SQL Server**.  

Additionally, the pipeline integrates **Azure Databricks** with **PySpark** to process and analyze IoT data in real time, enabling advanced analytics and **machine learning applications** such as anomaly detection and predictive modeling.  

The processed data is visualized through **Power BI dashboards**, providing interactive insights into key metrics, usage patterns, and anomalies for effective decision-making.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- **IoT Data Simulation:** Generated real-time telemetry data using Python.  
- **Stream Processing:** Used Azure Stream Analytics to process and store data in SQL Server.  
- **Big Data Analytics:** Integrated Azure Databricks with PySpark for scalable data processing and machine learning.  
- **Visualization and Insights:** Designed Power BI dashboards to monitor trends, performance, and alerts.  
- **Use Cases:** Enabled real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics for IoT systems.
